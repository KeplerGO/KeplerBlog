It serves as a repository for community-gathered follow-up data and is supported by the NASA &lt;a href="http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html"&gt;Exoplanet Archive&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to continuing to support Kepler via the original &lt;a href="https://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu/home/"&gt;CFOP website&lt;/a&gt;, this new service includes the K2 targets, and will eventually be expanded to support future missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is open to the entire community and currently contains magnitudes, finding charts, and nearby source lists for the targets from Campaigns 0-4 and the engineering campaign. A new feature allows users to designate possible planetary candidates, false positives and eclipsing binaries. ExoFOP-K2 will allow detailed searches of K2 targets similar to the CFOP search pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All content can be viewed and downloaded without logging in. A username and password are only required if you wish to upload data, notes, or files. Existing CFOP user name and password will work on ExoFOP-K2.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Microlensing Campaign Draft Agenda Now Available</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/blog/k2-microlensing-campaign-draft-agenda-now-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-24T06:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-04-24:blog/k2-microlensing-campaign-draft-agenda-now-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Agenda/"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt; is now available for the &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/"&gt;K2 Microlensing Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. This will likely be updated as we get closer to the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Venue/"&gt;venue for the workshop&lt;/a&gt; will be the SETI Institute in Mountain View, CA. Note that this is a change to the originally advertised venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be talks from Steve Howell (K2 Project Scientist, NASA Ames), Tom Barclay (K2 Guest Observer Office Director, NASA Ames), Doug Hudgins (NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Scientist and K2 Deputy Program Scientist, NASA HQ) and Fergal Mullally (K2 Science Officer, NASA Ames), in addition to contributed talks from members of the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Microlensing Campaign Workshop, May 7-8, 2015, SETI Inst., CA</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/blog/k2-microlensing-campaign-workshop-may-7-8-2015-seti-inst-ca.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-24T05:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-04-24:blog/k2-microlensing-campaign-workshop-may-7-8-2015-seti-inst-ca.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that this meeting will now be hosted at the SETI Inst.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April of 2016, the NASA K2 mission will execute Campaign 9, a continuous 75-day long campaign targeting the galactic bulge dedicated to a single Microlensing Science Experiment. The &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2"&gt;NASA K2 mission&lt;/a&gt; is sponsoring a &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop"&gt;1.5-day workshop on the topic of the K2 Microlensing Experiment&lt;/a&gt; on May 7-8, 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivations for holding this workshop are two-fold: Firstly to provide an opportunity for interactive planning for the K2 Microlensing Experiment amongst NASA, the K2 project and the scientific community; and secondly to serve as a pre-proposal discussion opportunity in advance of the submission of K2 Microlensing Science Team proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 project staff will describe the observing plan and operating procedures for up-linking target lists, down-linking the observed data and the time-line for archiving products. NASA HQ and K2 staff will present information regarding the proposal process, possible avenues for investigation, and funding. We are also inviting attendees to present information valuable in the planning and preparation for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will begin at 9.00am PST on Thursday May 7 and end at 12.00pm PST on Friday May 8, 2015. The venue will be the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. We are intending to have available limited facilities for &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Callin"&gt;virtual participation&lt;/a&gt;. To &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Apply"&gt;apply to attend the workshop&lt;/a&gt; either in-person or virtually you will need to fill in the &lt;a href="http://goo.gl/forms/ESGRMC8vOJ"&gt;application form&lt;/a&gt;.

Campaign 2 &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC02.shtml"&gt;target list&lt;/a&gt; consists of 13,399 standard long cadence and 54 short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over the clusters M4 and M80. If a target falls within either the M4 or M80 large mask it will not appear in the target list. Two Solar System bodies were selected - trans-Neptunian object (278361) 2007 JJ43 and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). The Solar System bodies are moving relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. The full cluster and Solar System pixel masks are made up of many smaller masks.

There's a MAST Classic Search Interface so you can get lightcurves based on target IDs, coordinates, EPIC catalog fluxes, etc. You can also use our interactive plotter to explore the lightcurves using any of the photometric apertures before downloading the FITS files.
