Target Pixel Files from K2 [Campaign 2](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC02.shtml) have been delivered and are [available at the MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/). Campaign 2 [target list](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC02.shtml) consists of 13,399 standard long cadence and 54 short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over the clusters M4 and M80. If a target falls within either the M4 or M80 large mask it will not appear in the target list. Two Solar System bodies were selected - trans-Neptunian object (278361) 2007 JJ43 and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). The Solar System bodies are moving relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. The full cluster and Solar System pixel masks are made up of many smaller masks.
