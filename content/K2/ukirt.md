The Kepler/K2 project office has been awarded 30 hours to use [UIST](http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/instruments/uist/uist.html) on [UKIRT](http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/) for spectroscopic characterization of K2 targets.  The aim of the UKIRT program is to provide a uniform catalog of K-band spectra of K2 targets of interest, with a focus on cool exoplanet hosts discovered by K2.  Spectra of ~90 K2 targets will be acquired in the 2015B semester.  K2 Campaign 0 targets are visible in December/January, Campaign 3 targets are visible in August, and Campaign 4 targets are visible in November.  Members of the community are encouraged to submit targets for this program to the [GO Office](mailto:keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov).  All spectra will be made publicly available on the [ExoFOP](https://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/).
