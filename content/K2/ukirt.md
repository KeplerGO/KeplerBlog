The Kepler/K2 project office has been awarded 30 hours to use [UIST](http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/instruments/uist/uist.html) on [UKIRT](http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/) for spectroscopic characterization of K2 targets.  The aim of the UKIRT program is to provide a uniform catalog of K-band spectra of K2 targets of interest, with a focus on cool exoplanet hosts discovered by K2.  We expect to acquire spectra of ~90 K2 targets in the 2015B semester.  Targets from Campaigns 0, 3, and 4 are visible around December/January, August/September, and November, respectively.  Members of the community are encouraged to submit targets for this program to the [GO Office](mailto:keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov), keeping in mind that all spectra will be made publicly available on the [ExoFOP](https://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/).
