[K2 Campaign 9](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html) will be executed in April 2016 and
will be dedicated to a study of gravitational microlensing events. The
Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft
observing in the +VV direction at fields toward the Galactic
bulge. The aim of this program is to simultaneously observe
gravitational microlensing events with K2 and from Earth in order to
see a parallax effect in the shape and time of the lensing event.

The Microlensing Science Team (MST) was selected through a peer-review
process during K2 GO Cycle 3 by a panel of professional volunteers.
The MST will coordinate with and make recommendations to the K2 Guest
Observer (GO) and Project Offices regarding the observational planning
of Campaign 9. The MST is composed of the following people:

* David Bennett (University of Notre Dame)
* Andrew Gould (Ohio State University)
* Calen Henderson (Ohio State University)
* David Hogg (New York University, Inc.)
* Matthew Penny (Ohio State University)
* Rachel Street (Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, Inc.)

In order to best maximize the scientific returns from the microlensing
data, Campaign 9 targets will be selected by the MST in coordination
with the K2 GO and Project Offices. Campaign 9 will therefore differ
from previous and future K2 Campaigns, where targets are proposed by
the community at large. However, a small number of pixels will be
available for approved Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) programs.
